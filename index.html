    <h1>ðŸ‘œ Hand Bags</h1>
    <p>
      The very first handbags were literally crude pouches fashioned from leaves
      and animal hide. However, the first documented use of handbags is from the
      14th centuryEgyptian hieroglyphics which depict men carrying little sacks
      around the waist. Called pockets, these handbags were hung by thongs at
      the back of the girdle, and were used mainly by men to carry flint or
      money.
